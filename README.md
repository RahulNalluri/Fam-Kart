# FamilyKart AI

FamilyKart AI is a multilingual grocery list app for Indian families.

The app is designed to help family members manage a shared shopping list together. Each person in a household will be able to add, update, complete, and remove grocery items so everyone stays in sync.

FamilyKart AI will initially support English and Telugu, with future support planned for voice-based grocery commands and Telugu-English mixed input.

## Status

This project is currently under development.

Phase 1 builds the project foundation: backend health API, mobile welcome screen, local Docker services, and test tooling.

The backend is under development. It currently provides health checks, database
foundations, password security utilities, and user registration through
`POST /api/v1/auth/register`. Registered users can authenticate and receive
access and refresh tokens through `POST /api/v1/auth/login`.
